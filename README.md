# Website Time Tracker
<i>A chrome extension to track where you spend your time on the web.</i>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  This project creates a chrome extension that uses the Chrome History API to pull out websites you've visited during
  a time-slice. It groups these websites together by domain, and displays the count numbers in tabular and graph
  format.
</p>
<p>
  For the graph, I'm using <a href="http://d3js.org/">d3</a> and <a href="http://nvd3.org/">nvd3</a> libraries, 
  which must be included as part of the chrome extension package.
</p>

<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>
  The main point of this project is to learn something while making something that might be useful. I'm planning
  on releasing it to the Chrome store when finished, although I realize there are several extensions out there already
  that have similar functionality. I'm not really worried about that, as this is more of an exercise and the chance
  to possibly collaborate with friends on a simple project.
